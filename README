Run scons to compile.

Notice that T1 is only 32-bit.

The command line should be the following:
./t1 -p -x -S dqbfs -W 1 -d domain.pddl -i problem.pddl

or use the scripts attached.

In all this, you're missing a folder called "libdnnf" containing an executable c2d_linux: it is Darwiche's DNNF compiler. I am not allowed to distribute it, but you can get a copy from his web page (and then copy the file c2d_linux in libdnnf/):
